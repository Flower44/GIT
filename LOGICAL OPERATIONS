   LOGICAL OPERATIONS
   => Operations that controls the conditions of certain statements.
   => Outcome of the Logical Operations are boolean(true/false)

   -> grater than
   example: 6 > 4 => true.
            3 < 2 => false
   <----> less than operator
   ex: 23 < 50 => true
       12 < 4  => false

  ==     --> comprasion operator
  ex: 23 == 45 => false

  ! = -->  Not equal. Checks if two sides are not equal.

  ex: 34 != 100; => true
      12 !=12; => false

  &&  ---> AND --> it compares two independent comparison and checks if both are true or not.

              AND OPERATOR(&&)  ----> Truth table for AND
  1  |  2
  true | true  => true
  false| true  => false
  true | false => false
  false| false => false



  || ----> OR OPERATOR => At least one condition MUST be true.


  true  |  false  => true
  true  |  true   => true
  false |  true   => false
  false |  false  => false
