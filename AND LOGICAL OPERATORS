OR(||) , AND(&&)











AND LOGICAL OPERATOR =>  &&

-> In order to get true as aresult, both conditions MUST be True.

true - true => true
true - false => false
false -false => false
false -true => false


            RELATIONS OPERATORS


 >= GREATER THAN OR EQUAL
 --> When given condition is greater or equals to second expression, statement returns true.
 Ex: 4 >=2: TRUE;
     4>4: FALSE;
     4>= 4: TRUE;
     3>= 5: FALSE;

 <=LESS THAN EQUAL
 --> WHEN GIVEN CONDITION IS LESS OR EQUALS TO SECOND EXPRESSION, STATEMENT RETURNS TRUE.





&& ---> short version of AND operator
    =>  This returns result whenever it has enough information to make final decision.

    false && true => false
    true &&  false => false

    & ----> This returns result , but checks both conditions ALL time.

    Ex: int age = 19;
        String name "Jmaes";


       (age >=  21) &&(name == "James") --> false 
       false && true ----->false








   &&







 IQ: Interview Question
 | vs || -->
 & vs && -->
 When do you use single over double AND or OR?
 - Single AND or OR is used when you have certain assignment or actions happen on the second condition.





 --> If- Else STEMENTS ARE USED TO CHECK CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND BASED ON THAT CONDITION RESULTS WE ARE CONTROLING THE FLOW OF THE PROGRAM

 DOUBLE BALANCE = 500;
   If balance is >= Tnx 1;

  JAVA :
  1. Tnx 1 --> 300$
     balance -= 300;

  2. Tnx 2 --> 200$
     balance -= 120$;





***** When comparing Strings DON'T USE ==comparison.
USE .equals() method.
